**Summary:** 

### Objective:

1. Create a tool that allows players to easily check the attributes of a horse.

**Objective 1:** *test*

First, I needed a way to obtain data about each horse. I went to the Speed Star game website where it displayed horses. By opening a network inspect window and filtering by “api”, I was able to identify a URL which listed all of the data I needed in JSON format.
